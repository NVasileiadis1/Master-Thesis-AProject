Multiscale Structural Complexity (MCS) relation to Perceptual Complexity. Use of intermediate outputs of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network Vgg16. There is also a custom optimazation algorithm with the use of a stochastic gradient decent optimizer (adam) using as the objective the value of MSC.
